# Backup Solution Implementation SOP
## Purpose:
- To provide a standardized process for implementing scheduled backups to desktop, laptops, and servers in order to facilitate data security, integrity, and availability.
## Scope:
- This SOP applies to the IT department and any employees using computers within the organization.
## Responsibilities:
- IT department: Create, configure, and deploy backup solutions to devices within the company.
- Employees: Comply with AUP and security guidelines.
## Prerequisites:
- IT department completes documentation regarding backup solutions for review and approvals by management.
## Backup Procedure:
- IT department will allocate storage space for backups to be stored in servers for centralized control.
- IT department will schedule backups for each desktop, laptop, and server based on how often data changes (full backup, incremental, and differential ).
- IT department will encrypt the folder containing the backups of devices.
- IT department will periodically test the restore function of the backup solution.
## Restore Procedure:
- IT department will provide guides on how to restore from a backup.
- IT department will provide assistance to users via remote desktop protocol if users need the assistance.  
## User Training:
- Employees are given training on desktop and laptop best practices.

## Definitions:
- AUP: Acceptable Use Policy, is a document that outlines the acceptable ways in which a computer network or system may be used. It is a set of rules and guidelines that define the proper use of an organization's information technology resources by its employees.
- Full backups: A full backup involves copying all selected files and folders to a backup storage location.
- Incremental backups: An incremental backup only copies the data that has changed since the last backup (whether it's a full or incremental backup).
- Differential backups: A differential backup copies all the data that has changed since the last full backup. Unlike incremental backups, which only capture changes since the last backup of any type, differentials always reference the last full backup.
- Restore: A restore is the process of recovering data or a system to a previous state, typically after a data loss event or a system failure. The goal of a restore is to return the data or system to a functional and usable state, using previously backed-up copies of the data or system configuration. 
- Encryption: Encryption is an essential component of secure backup practices, and various encryption methods can be used to protect backup data.
